The Oauthwo private signing key, by which the AS signs the issued tokens,
is oauthwo/keys/key.pem
That file name is defined in oauthwo/application/modules/oauth/Bootstrap.php
(that should be instead defined in some config file or table, not in the
program).

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
The key must be made readable by the PHP interpreter exclusively
("chown apache:apache key.pem && chmod 400 key.pem").
The script set_up.sh will do that; run it as root, after placing
the oauthwo software under /var/www/<somewhere>
